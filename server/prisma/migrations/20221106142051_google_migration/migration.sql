  - You are about to alter the column `secondTeamPoints` on the `Guess` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `String` to `Int`.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[googleId]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
